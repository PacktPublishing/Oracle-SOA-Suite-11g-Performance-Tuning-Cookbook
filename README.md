**Over 100 recipes to get the best performance from your Oracle SOA Suite 11g infrastructure**

## What is this book about?
Oracle SOA Suite 11g forms the heart of many organisations’ Service Oriented Architecture. Yet for such a core component, simple information on how to tune and configure SOA Suite and its infrastructure is hard to find. Because Oracle SOA Suite 11g builds on top of a variety of infrastructure components, up until now there has been no one single complete reference that brings together all the best practices for tuning the whole SOA stack.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Monitor your SOA Suite environment 
Configure the memory available to the Java Virtual Machine 
Tune the Java garbage collector 
Configure a WebLogic server to handle large loads 
Tune BPEL, BPMN, and Mediator engines 
Performance test your application 
Design your SOA Suite components for maximum performance 
Configure a cluster of SOA Suite servers 
Tune the operating system and virtualization layers for SOA Suite
